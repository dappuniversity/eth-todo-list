 A decentralized application (DApp) for managing a to-do list. The DApp is built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts and a web-based user interface.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

Smart Contracts:

Migrations.sol: A basic contract used for managing migrations.
TodoList.sol: The main contract for managing tasks on the to-do list.
Truffle Migration Scripts:

1_initial_migration.js: Deploys the Migrations contract.
2_deploy_contract.js: Deploys the TodoList contract.
Front-End Web Application:

app.js: JavaScript code for the web interface of the DApp.
index.html: The HTML template for the DApp's user interface.
Test Scripts:

TodoList.test.js: Tests for the TodoList contract to ensure its functionality.
This DApp was created as part of a tutorial by Dapp University.
